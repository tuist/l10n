At Tuist, we’ve been localizing product pages, docs, and release notes for years. We tried Crowdin and Weblate. They’re good at managing translators, but the workflow forced us to export content out of the repo and import it back in. That indirection broke our automation and slowed the loop.

We wanted a workflow that feels like shipping software:

- Change content in Git.
- Run the same validators locally.
- Generate a draft with an LLM.
- Review what matters, then merge.

So we built l10n. It reads configuration from `L10N.md`, uses your local or hosted model, validates output, and keeps translations next to the content they belong to. It’s deliberately simple, and designed to evolve with the way teams work.

If you’re iterating quickly and don’t want translation to be a separate pipeline, l10n is for you.
